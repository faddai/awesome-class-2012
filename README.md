# Warning: 
## This code is for example and practical purposes only. It is not fully hackproofed. Some part of the code was written in such a way that it can be easily explained in class without frustrating you with a lot of concepts. Make sure you understand what is basically going before copying and pasting.

## Some parts of this application are not advisable for you to directly apply in your life saving applications although I have tried hard to minimize that.

## Jump ahead and learn more. There are a lot of things that I did not cover, I leave it all up to you to discover for yourself.
